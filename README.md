# GPC

<h2>General Purpose Control Board</h2>

<h3>The Motivation</h3>
This is a project I am starting that is a general-function PCB for education. Something I struggled with when I was getting into the world of ECE was finding information that wasn't as simple as Arduino, but also not as complex as industrial PLCs. So, I am making this project. a happy medium is something I know others want, and hopefully, this will help with this problem. This is a full board, as opposed to a hat for an Arduino, as I want this to be easy to use. By the point a person gets to learning this stuff, they should have already mastered using a breadboard and connecting things to it. This just led me to decide to make it all one PCB. 

<h3>What is it?</h3>
GPC is an educational development board, wiht the following features:
- 2 Stepper Drivers
- 2 DC Motor Drivers
- And more!

 Right now this project is in development. I am finishing the PCB design, and looking to order a test batch soon.
