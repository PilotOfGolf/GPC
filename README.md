# GPC

<h2>General Purpose Controller Board</h2>

<h3>The Motivation</h3>
This is a project I am starting that is a general-function PCB for education. Something I struggled with when I was getting into the world of ECE was finding information that wasn't as simple as Arduino, but also not as complex as industrial PLCs. So, I am making this project. a happy medium is something I know others want, and hopefully, this will help with this problem. This is a full board, as opposed to a hat for an Arduino, as I want this to be easy to use. By the point a person gets to learning this stuff, they should have already mastered using a breadboard and connecting things to it. This just led me to decide to make it all one PCB. 

<h3>What is it?</h3>
GPC is an educational development board, with the following features:

1. 2 Stepper Drivers
2. 2 DC Motor Drivers
3. RP2040 Chip
4. And more!

This is just a fun little open-source project I am doing hopefully to make the fun world of electronics circuits, and programming seem more accessible. 

<h3>Timeline</h3>
Right now this project is in development. I am finishing the PCB design, and looking to order a test batch soon. The goal is to have the boards finalized by the end of 2024, or at the latest March of 2025. Then I will need to make documentation for this project. This should hopefully be done not long after the boards are public (1-2 Months - 3 at the latest). This isn't an area I want to skimp on. High-quality documentation is important, especially as this is a project that aims to be educational. 

<h3>Cost</h3>
The ideal budget for this is $50 per board. This will allow the board to have plenty of functions, and still be high quality.
